Hi , 
I did try my best to do exactly as it was told in Code Review description.
However i didn't understand quiet well the Tasks that were descriped.
For example :
(10 points) Use relative measurements on the width property of the elements (e.g. em, %, vw...) to make your page responsive (at least the images should resize and look nice when changing the browser size).
I am aware that we didn't cover it in classes but i tried do my Best.
I spent too much time trying to figure it out and searching the Web for solutions but it didn't go very well.

I would like to give my best to try to finish the Course with Summa cum laude , thats why i wouldn't like to lose any points if that is possible.

I hope you will recosinder this option.
Thank you.
